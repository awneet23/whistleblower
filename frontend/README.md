## The Problem
Whistleblowers have no guarantee of being paid for their information, and news organizations have no way to verify information before paying. This is a trust-based system with critical flaws.

## Our Solution
This platform uses a smart contract escrow system to create a trustless exchange. News organizations lock funds in a bounty, and whistleblowers are paid automatically and anonymously when their information is approved.

## How It Works
1.  **Bounty Creation:** News orgs post bounties with funds locked in escrow.
2.  **Anonymous Claims:** Whistleblowers submit encrypted claims with public teasers.
3.  **Trustless Payment:** If the org approves the teaser, the smart contract automatically pays the whistleblower and grants the org access to the full data.
